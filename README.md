# Hi there, I'm Ashley Hahn 👋
Business Intelligence Analyst with hands-on experience in cost tracking, margin analysis, and performance reporting for e-commerce brands.

I specialize in transforming raw data into clean, actionable insights that improve forecasting, profitability, and marketing efficiency. I’m skilled in building dashboards and financial models using Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Tableau to support better business decisions.

I completed TripleTen’s rigorous BI Analyst program, where I built end-to-end projects involving customer segmentation, profitability analysis, and sales trend forecasting using real datasets.

Currently working as a Freelance Data Analyst, I’ve designed dynamic Excel tools to reforecast Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC), performed SKU and bundle-level margin analysis, and helped structure a data-driven June promo strategy for an e-commerce business.

I’m passionate about solving real business problems with clean logic, strong visuals, and data storytelling that actually makes sense.
